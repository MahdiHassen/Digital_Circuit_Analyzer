# Digital_Circuit_Analyzer

*Current Verson v0.1a (first working version)*

### Intro (v0.1a)

This project was created by me, there are a ton of things that need fixing outlines below, the next few commits will be focused on stablilty and making code more readable. Currently the program only works for digital circits that are asychrnous and reach an eventual steady state. 

### About the Project

Simple Digital Circuit Simulator coded entirely in Java, currently takes text input in a custom format that will be outlined below.

### Goals list
future/current goals of the projects

-[X] Generate Truth Tables
-[ ] Detect non-steady-state cases 
-[ ] Generate clock pulses for synchronous circuits 
-[ ] Generate waveforms 
-[ ] Create sandbox-like GUI

### What doesn't work

- Making Circuit that doesn't have a defined output(s) will result in a random output
- Duplicate names cause plethora of issues
- Probably more things that I haven't tested yet
